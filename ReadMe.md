# dotfiles

> Just some of my dotfiles...

Since I use both OS X, ArchLinux and Fedora, I have split up the dotfiles into separate folders.

- [Linux dotfiles][arch]
- [OS X dotfiles][osx]

- - -

Some of the content _(functions/aliases)_ are sometime being removed and moved to their own scripts instead. You'll most likely find those scripts in the [junkyard][jy].
