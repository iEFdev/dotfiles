dotfiles :: Linux
=================

This is a set of the dotfiles I use with ArchLinux.

_@ the time, same as before, minus the OS X stuff. Need to add the Pacman stuff + a few more_

notes
-----

Some aliases and functions are using `x-clip`.

Look in your package manager, or download it [here][xclip].
